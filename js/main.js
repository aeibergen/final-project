This map offers insight into the richness of numerous terrestrial classes and orders.</p><h2>Amphibians</h2><p>Amphibians are ectothermic, or cold blooded, which means they regulate their body temperature behaviorally via the outside world. Amphibians are typically four-limbed vertebrates. They have smooth, unscaly, permeable skin that helps them absorb oxygen. Some amphibians even produce toxins using their skin glands to deter predators. Modern Amphibians are generally grouped as Caecilian (limbless amphibians), Caudata (salamanders) and, and Anura (frogs). As you can see from the map, amphibians as a whole occupy a large amount of the earth. Most amphibians live in or around aquatic ecosystems, as water is crucial to their reproduction. Most amphibians begin life in the water, and experience metamorphosis to move from an adolescent with gills to an adult that breathes air. Due to their close relationship with water, amphibians are typically good environmental indicators.</p><h3>Caecilian</h3><p>These amphibians are unlike others in that they are limbless. You probably have not encountered these, as they live underground and are not commonly seen. They can be as small as earthworms and can grow as large as 5 feet long. As you can see from the map they are mostly located in South and Central America. Their diet consists of earthworms and other small creatures that live underground. Like frogs, caecilians skin secretes chemicals to deter predators. They are adapted for burrowing, but some species also can swim (similarly to eels) in bodies of water. Caecilians are less affected by climate change than some of the other species of amphibian; however, those who live in regions where deforestation or massive landscape changes are taking place are feeling the effects of losing large portions of their habitat. This is especially concerning because some caecilians are specific to very small regions and therefore are extremely vulnerable to habitat loss.</p>	<h3>Anura</h3><p>Anura, more commonly referred to as frogs, are members of a group of short bodied amphibians that, in their adult form, lack a tail. As you can see from the map, frogs are widely distributed, but most species are located in tropical rainforests, such as the Amazon Rainforest. Due to their life cycle largely involving water, most species live in moist areas, but a few species have adapted to dry habitats. Frogs are extremely diverse, and make up more than 85% of living amphibians. Frogs normally lay their eggs in water, which then hatch into tadpoles and eventually metamorphize into adults. Adult frogs are typically carnivorous and eat small invertebrates, but some species are omnivorous. We generally call warty frogs toads, but this is based solely on informal naming, and many toads are very closely related to frogs. More than one third of frog species are considered to be threatened and over 120 species have become extinct since the 1980s. Frogs have had increasing malformations, and a fungal disease called chytridiomycosis has spread around the world - even frogs in quarantine are being afflicted by the fungus. </p><h3>Caudata</h3><p>Caudata are known more commonly as salamanders. They have slender bodies and short legs. Unlike other amphibians, salamanders have a tail in both their adolescent and adult forms. As you can see on the map, they are mostly found in the Northern Hemisphere. Like many other amphibians, salamanders. Although most salamanders are small, two species can reach up to 5 feet in length. They are also nocturnal. They live in or around water – only a few species are completely terrestrial in adulthood. Salamanders can regenerate lost limbs within a few weeks, which allows them greater survivability of predator attacks. Due to the chytrid fungus that afflicts amphibians and destruction of wetland habitats, populations have dramatically decreased over the last few years.</p>	<h3>Threatened Amphibians</h3><p>Although we are constantly discovering new amphibians, in the past 50 years we have been experiencing a rapid decline in amphibians, and scientists are not entirely sure why.

This map offers insight into the richness of numerous terrestrial classes and orders.</p><h2>Amphibians</h2><p>Amphibians are ectothermic, or cold blooded, which means they regulate their body temperature behaviorally via the outside world. Amphibians are typically four-limbed vertebrates. They have smooth, unscaly, permeable skin that helps them absorb oxygen. Some amphibians even produce toxins using their skin glands to deter predators. Modern Amphibians are generally grouped as Caecilian (limbless amphibians), Caudata (salamanders) and, and Anura (frogs). As you can see from the map, amphibians as a whole occupy a large amount of the earth. Most amphibians live in or around aquatic ecosystems, as water is crucial to their reproduction. Most amphibians begin life in the water, and experience metamorphosis to move from an adolescent with gills to an adult that breathes air. Due to their close relationship with water, amphibians are typically good environmental indicators.</p><h3>Caecilian</h3><p>These amphibians are unlike others in that they are limbless. You probably have not encountered these, as they live underground and are not commonly seen. They can be as small as earthworms and can grow as large as 5 feet long. As you can see from the map they are mostly located in South and Central America. Their diet consists of earthworms and other small creatures that live underground. Like frogs, caecilians skin secretes chemicals to deter predators. They are adapted for burrowing, but some species also can swim (similarly to eels) in bodies of water. Caecilians are less affected by climate change than some of the other species of amphibian; however, those who live in regions where deforestation or massive landscape changes are taking place are feeling the effects of losing large portions of their habitat. This is especially concerning because some caecilians are specific to very small regions and therefore are extremely vulnerable to habitat loss.</p>	<h3>Anura</h3><p>Anura, more commonly referred to as frogs, are members of a group of short bodied amphibians that, in their adult form, lack a tail. As you can see from the map, frogs are widely distributed, but most species are located in tropical rainforests, such as the Amazon Rainforest. Due to their life cycle largely involving water, most species live in moist areas, but a few species have adapted to dry habitats. Frogs are extremely diverse, and make up more than 85% of living amphibians. Frogs normally lay their eggs in water, which then hatch into tadpoles and eventually metamorphize into adults. Adult frogs are typically carnivorous and eat small invertebrates, but some species are omnivorous. We generally call warty frogs toads, but this is based solely on informal naming, and many toads are very closely related to frogs. More than one third of frog species are considered to be threatened and over 120 species have become extinct since the 1980s. Frogs have had increasing malformations, and a fungal disease called chytridiomycosis has spread around the world - even frogs in quarantine are being afflicted by the fungus. </p><h3>Caudata</h3><p>Caudata are known more commonly as salamanders. They have slender bodies and short legs. Unlike other amphibians, salamanders have a tail in both their adolescent and adult forms. As you can see on the map, they are mostly found in the Northern Hemisphere. Like many other amphibians, salamanders. Although most salamanders are small, two species can reach up to 5 feet in length. They are also nocturnal. They live in or around water – only a few species are completely terrestrial in adulthood. Salamanders can regenerate lost limbs within a few weeks, which allows them greater survivability of predator attacks. Due to the chytrid fungus that afflicts amphibians and destruction of wetland habitats, populations have dramatically decreased over the last few years.</p>	<h3>Threatened Amphibians</h3><p>Although we are constantly discovering new amphibians, in the past 50 years we have been experiencing a rapid decline in amphibians, and scientists are not entirely sure why.

Feathers are used as a barrier against the water, provide insulation from cold, provide a flat surface to push against the air during flight, and are used, especially by brightly colored males, to attract mates. Although all birds have fore-limbs adapted into wings, their hind limbs vary in purpose; depending upon the species, they can be used for walking, perching, swimming, or some combination. In lieu of typical jaws, birds’ jaws are modified into different shaped beaks, depending upon their diet. Birds can be a wide range of sizes – from a two inch tall hummingbird, to an ostrich that can reach heights of eight feet. This high level of variablity allows birds to occupy a wide variety of habitats.</p><h3>Psittaciformes</h3><p>Psittaciformes are parrots and related birds such as lorikeets, macaws, and cockatoos. They commonly have strong, curved beaks; strong legs; and clawed feet. They subsist off seeds, nuts, fruits, and other organic plant materials. Parrots are one of the most intelligent birds, and are popular pets, partially due to their ability to imitate human speech. However, because of parrots’ popularity as pets, habitat loss, and invasive species, wild parrot populations have diminished.</p><h3>Passeriformes</h3><p>Passerines are birds of the order Passeriformes, which are distinguished by the arrangement of their toes: three pointing forward, and one back. This arrangement makes it easier for the birds to perch, which resulted in their common name “perching birds.” Most passerines who live in trees do not fall from their perch while asleep because when they bend their ankles to squat on a perch, tension on their tendons automatically closes the toes around the perch. Passerines account for more than half of all species of birds. As you can see from the map, passerines are found throughout the world in many different habitats.</p><h3>Non-Passeriformes</h3><p>Non-Passeriformes, or non-Passerines are birds who do not belong to the order Passeriformes. This means that they could have any toe combinations – two forward, two backward; two forward, one backward; etc. Additionally, this includes birds with webbed feet. Some examples of birds that belong to this order are turkeys, geese, ducks, and cranes.</p><h3>Trochilidae</h3><p>Trochilidae, or hummingbirds, are known for their small size (the smallest hummingbird weighs 2 grams) and quick wing movements. They belong to the order Apodiformes, which means “unfooted birds.” They have tiny feet and are unable to walk on the ground. Their diet consists of nectar and flowers, supplemented with small insects on occasion. Their bills are shaped specifically for the flowers that they feed off and their ability to hover also allows them to extract nectar more easily. Hummingbirds are the only birds that are able to hover, due to specialized skeletal and flight muscles. Hummingbirds play an important role in pollinating many plants – in Brazil they pollinate 58 different plant species. Humans have had a large impact on hummingbird survivability. Previously, we hunted them for their feathers, which we used to make jewelry. Now, they are being threatened by habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation. However, habitat destruction in the tropics has not threatened hummingbirds as much as some other species, as hummingbirds are typically able to find suitable habitats in human modified landscapes. In North America, some species have even increased their population and range, as hummingbird feeders and flower gardens allow them to move around more.</p><h3>Passeri</h3><p>Passeri, or songbirds, include birds who have a vocal organ developed specifically for “singing.” The reason why songbirds sing can vary – it can be to defend territory, communicate position, or to mate. Nearly all birds have a call of some kind, but songbirds have more intricate songs, and also know more varieties of songs. They disperse seeds and pollinate flowers, which helps the ecosystem and survival of plant species. They feed on insects that cause disease among plants. However, in recent years there has been a significant decline in the number of songbirds, and studies show that song bird habitat fragmentation due to human changes and modifications of the environment could be one of the main reasons for this decline.</p><h3>Threatened Birds</h3><p>Humans have greatly affected birds and their habitats. Birds were once considered an inexhaustible resource; thus, they were killed in large quantities for various purposes, or no purpose at all. Our expansion of infrastructure such as cities, roads, and farms has infringed upon their natural habitats.

In lieu of typical jaws, birds’ jaws are modified into different shaped beaks, depending upon their diet. Birds can be a wide range of sizes – from a two inch tall hummingbird, to an ostrich that can reach heights of eight feet. This high level of variablity allows birds to occupy a wide variety of habitats.</p><h3>Psittaciformes</h3><p>Psittaciformes are parrots and related birds such as lorikeets, macaws, and cockatoos. They commonly have strong, curved beaks; strong legs; and clawed feet. They subsist off seeds, nuts, fruits, and other organic plant materials. Parrots are one of the most intelligent birds, and are popular pets, partially due to their ability to imitate human speech. However, because of parrots’ popularity as pets, habitat loss, and invasive species, wild parrot populations have diminished.</p><h3>Passeriformes</h3><p>Passerines are birds of the order Passeriformes, which are distinguished by the arrangement of their toes: three pointing forward, and one back. This arrangement makes it easier for the birds to perch, which resulted in their common name “perching birds.” Most passerines who live in trees do not fall from their perch while asleep because when they bend their ankles to squat on a perch, tension on their tendons automatically closes the toes around the perch. Passerines account for more than half of all species of birds. As you can see from the map, passerines are found throughout the world in many different habitats.</p><h3>Non-Passeriformes</h3><p>Non-Passeriformes, or non-Passerines are birds who do not belong to the order Passeriformes. This means that they could have any toe combinations – two forward, two backward; two forward, one backward; etc. Additionally, this includes birds with webbed feet. Some examples of birds that belong to this order are turkeys, geese, ducks, and cranes.</p><h3>Trochilidae</h3><p>Trochilidae, or hummingbirds, are known for their small size (the smallest hummingbird weighs 2 grams) and quick wing movements. They belong to the order Apodiformes, which means “unfooted birds.” They have tiny feet and are unable to walk on the ground. Their diet consists of nectar and flowers, supplemented with small insects on occasion. Their bills are shaped specifically for the flowers that they feed off and their ability to hover also allows them to extract nectar more easily. Hummingbirds are the only birds that are able to hover, due to specialized skeletal and flight muscles. Hummingbirds play an important role in pollinating many plants – in Brazil they pollinate 58 different plant species. Humans have had a large impact on hummingbird survivability. Previously, we hunted them for their feathers, which we used to make jewelry. Now, they are being threatened by habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation. However, habitat destruction in the tropics has not threatened hummingbirds as much as some other species, as hummingbirds are typically able to find suitable habitats in human modified landscapes. In North America, some species have even increased their population and range, as hummingbird feeders and flower gardens allow them to move around more.</p><h3>Passeri</h3><p>Passeri, or songbirds, include birds who have a vocal organ developed specifically for “singing.” The reason why songbirds sing can vary – it can be to defend territory, communicate position, or to mate. Nearly all birds have a call of some kind, but songbirds have more intricate songs, and also know more varieties of songs. They disperse seeds and pollinate flowers, which helps the ecosystem and survival of plant species. They feed on insects that cause disease among plants. However, in recent years there has been a significant decline in the number of songbirds, and studies show that song bird habitat fragmentation due to human changes and modifications of the environment could be one of the main reasons for this decline.</p><h3>Threatened Birds</h3><p>Humans have greatly affected birds and their habitats. Birds were once considered an inexhaustible resource; thus, they were killed in large quantities for various purposes, or no purpose at all. Our expansion of infrastructure such as cities, roads, and farms has infringed upon their natural habitats. Pollution from anthropogenic sources, such as pesticides and oil spills have further damaged bird populations.</p>");

This map offers insight into the richness of numerous terrestrial classes and orders.</p><h2>Mammals</h2><p>Mammals are endothermic, or warm blooded, vertebrates. To be classified as a mammal, the organism must also have hair on its body, and produce milk to feed its young. Most mammals live on land, but there are many that fly, or live in the ocean. Some species of mammals are intelligent and can use tools, or are self-aware. Mammals can communicate in several ways, but most communicate vocally. Humans are mammals, and have benefited from the domestication of other mammals, such as cows, dogs, and sheep (among others) which have allowed us to thrive on the earth. However, human effects on the climate and environment, such as poaching and deforestation, is the biggest threat to mammals. </p><h3>Carnivora</h3><p>The order Carnivora are descendants of a group of Paleocene mammals who were carnivorous. However, this does not mean that all current members of Carnivora eat strictly meat. As they have evolved, Carnivorans still primarily eat meat, but now include other food sources as well, as many are omnivores. As you can see from the map, members of Carnivora are well distributed throughout the world. Species belonging to Carnivora can be identified by their teeth: they have large premolars, which are sharp and specialized for cutting through meat and tendons, as well as six incisors, which is how many their ancestors had as well. Many Carnivorans are the top predator in their ecosystem, therefore, they play an important role in regulating populations of their prey. Due to many members of Carnivora being nuisances or threats to human livelihood (example: wolves eat humans’ cows and sheep), they have been threatened by humans for a long time. Major threats to members of Carnivora include habitat loss, fragmentation, and degredation; hunting for sport and for profit; and reluctance of humans to coexist with carnivorans.</p><h3>Cetartiodactyla</h3><p>This group includes even-toed hoofed mammals, such as cows and deer. As you can see from the map, cetartiodactyls can be found throughout the world. Most live entirely on land and can live in many habitats, such as forest, mountain, desert, or farmland. One example of an exception is the hippopotamus, which is semi-aquatic. Most cetartiodactyls are social animals that live in herds. Also, most are herbivores, but some are omnivorous. The biggest threats, other than predators, to cetartiodactyls is habitat loss and over hunting.</p><h3>Chiroptera</h3><p>Chiroptera are bats, and they make up about 20% of all living mammal species. They are the only mammals that can fly. Bats are primarily nocturnal, and navigate at night using echolocation. In more northern regions, bats hibernate during the winter. As you can see from the map, most bats reside in tropical areas, although many live throughout the world. Generally, if there are good roosts and enough food, you will find bats. They vary in what they eat, including fruit, nectar, pollen, insects, amphibians, and small rodents. One surprising fact about bats is that many live over 30 years in the wild. Bats are important to their ecosystems because they serve as pollinators and keep their prey populations, such as insects, in check. One fourth of bat species are considered threatened, and destruction of roost sites via deforestation and habitat degradation remain issues. Additionally, a fungus that lives on and kills hibernating bats called white nose syndrome, has led to greater losses.</p><h3>Eulipotyphla</h3><p>Eulipotyphla is an order of mammals that contains the hedgehogs, moles, and shrews. These animals are typically small to medium sized, have sharp teeth, long pointed snouts, and small eyes.</p><h3>Marsupials</h3><p>Marsupials are a group of mammals typically thought of as pouched mammals, such as the kangaroo. They keep their young in their pouch until the young are old enough to fend for themselves. Although marsupials are commonly associated with Australia and that is where they are mostly located, they can live in many other places. In North America, we have marsupials in the form of opossums. Marsupials are heavily affected by environmental degradation and deforestation.</p><h3>Primates</h3><p>Primates typically live in forested areas and have features that most likely were adaptations for forest life. They are highly social and typically live in groups, and most reside in the tropics and subtropics. Primates eat a variety of things, including leaves, fruit, insects, and meat. Human land use strategies, particularly using deforestation to change land use, is a huge threat to primates.</p><h3>Rodentia</h3><p>Rodents are highly diverse, but have one thing in common: their teeth are specialized for gnawing. As you can see from the map, they are found around the world, except for Antarctica and some islands. This is due to the fact that they are extremely diverse. Some live in the water, and some live only in deserts. Most are omnivorous; others only eat a few specific species. Humans generally dislike rodents, as the aisles in many hardware stores with multiple ways to kill mice and moles will demonstrate to you. However, aside from pest control, many rodents die by human-caused environmental degradation.</p><h3>Threatened Mammals</h3><p>Mammals are hunted or raced for sport, and are used as model organisms in science. Loss of mammal populations is primarily driven by anthropogenic (human caused) factors, such as poaching and habitat destruction, though there are efforts to stop this.</p>");

As you can see from the map, cetartiodactyls can be found throughout the world. Most live entirely on land and can live in many habitats, such as forest, mountain, desert, or farmland. One example of an exception is the hippopotamus, which is semi-aquatic. Most cetartiodactyls are social animals that live in herds. Also, most are herbivores, but some are omnivorous. The biggest threats, other than predators, to cetartiodactyls is habitat loss and over hunting.</p><h3>Chiroptera</h3><p>Chiroptera are bats, and they make up about 20% of all living mammal species. They are the only mammals that can fly. Bats are primarily nocturnal, and navigate at night using echolocation. In more northern regions, bats hibernate during the winter. As you can see from the map, most bats reside in tropical areas, although many live throughout the world. Generally, if there are good roosts and enough food, you will find bats. They vary in what they eat, including fruit, nectar, pollen, insects, amphibians, and small rodents. One surprising fact about bats is that many live over 30 years in the wild. Bats are important to their ecosystems because they serve as pollinators and keep their prey populations, such as insects, in check. One fourth of bat species are considered threatened, and destruction of roost sites via deforestation and habitat degradation remain issues. Additionally, a fungus that lives on and kills hibernating bats called white nose syndrome, has led to greater losses.</p><h3>Eulipotyphla</h3><p>Eulipotyphla is an order of mammals that contains the hedgehogs, moles, and shrews. These animals are typically small to medium sized, have sharp teeth, long pointed snouts, and small eyes.</p><h3>Marsupials</h3><p>Marsupials are a group of mammals typically thought of as pouched mammals, such as the kangaroo. They keep their young in their pouch until the young are old enough to fend for themselves. Although marsupials are commonly associated with Australia and that is where they are mostly located, they can live in many other places. In North America, we have marsupials in the form of opossums. Marsupials are heavily affected by environmental degradation and deforestation.</p><h3>Primates</h3><p>Primates typically live in forested areas and have features that most likely were adaptations for forest life. They are highly social and typically live in groups, and most reside in the tropics and subtropics. Primates eat a variety of things, including leaves, fruit, insects, and meat. Human land use strategies, particularly using deforestation to change land use, is a huge threat to primates.</p><h3>Rodentia</h3><p>Rodents are highly diverse, but have one thing in common: their teeth are specialized for gnawing. As you can see from the map, they are found around the world, except for Antarctica and some islands. This is due to the fact that they are extremely diverse. Some live in the water, and some live only in deserts. Most are omnivorous; others only eat a few specific species. Humans generally dislike rodents, as the aisles in many hardware stores with multiple ways to kill mice and moles will demonstrate to you. However, aside from pest control, many rodents die by human-caused environmental degradation.</p><h3>Threatened Mammals</h3><p>Mammals are hunted or raced for sport, and are used as model organisms in science. Loss of mammal populations is primarily driven by anthropogenic (human caused) factors, such as poaching and habitat destruction, though there are efforts to stop this.</p>");

This map offers insight into the richness of numerous terrestrial classes and orders.</p><h2>Mammals</h2><p>Mammals are endothermic, or warm blooded, vertebrates. To be classified as a mammal, the organism must also have hair on its body, and produce milk to feed its young. Most mammals live on land, but there are many that fly, or live in the ocean. Some species of mammals are intelligent and can use tools, or are self-aware. Mammals can communicate in several ways, but most communicate vocally. Humans are mammals, and have benefited from the domestication of other mammals, such as cows, dogs, and sheep (among others) which have allowed us to thrive on the earth. However, human effects on the climate and environment, such as poaching and deforestation, is the biggest threat to mammals. </p><h3>Carnivora</h3><p>The order Carnivora are descendants of a group of Paleocene mammals who were carnivorous. However, this does not mean that all current members of Carnivora eat strictly meat. As they have evolved, Carnivorans still primarily eat meat, but now include other food sources as well, as many are omnivores. As you can see from the map, members of Carnivora are well distributed throughout the world. Species belonging to Carnivora can be identified by their teeth: they have large premolars, which are sharp and specialized for cutting through meat and tendons, as well as six incisors, which is how many their ancestors had as well. Many Carnivorans are the top predator in their ecosystem, therefore, they play an important role in regulating populations of their prey.
